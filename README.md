# ESP8266 GarageDoorOpener
A garage door opener project and how I did it


### Parts to this project:

I chose to use the ESP8266 for the project because of how easy it is to program and it has wifi built in.
So the first thing we must do is create [a webserver on the ESP8266](https://github.com/Jarmahent/GarageDoorOpener/blob/master/Arduino/arduinServer/arduinServer.ino)
